# Notice to Contributors to Seven Bridges Open Source Projects

We require contributors to our open-source projects to sign a Seven
Bridges Contributor Agreement (SBCA). The SBCA doesn’t require you to
lose rights to your work, but only to share the copyright with Seven
Bridges jointly, and when applicable to grant Seven Bridges and other
collaborators and users of the project a patent license.

This is a common arrangement in larger open source projects, and
provides several benefits to both the project and its contributors. The
SBCA allows Seven Bridges to defend the project from hostile
intellectual property litigation--for example, if a contributor or their
employer attempted to assert control of the project, or rescind their
contribution. Seven Bridges could not do this without the consolidated
ownership of the copyright that the SBCA provides. Since the Agreement
establishes joint ownership of copyright, you and any other contributor
will have the right to whatever you want to with your contribution,
including contribute it to other open source projects or distribute it
under proprietary licenses. If we distribute your contribution in any
way, the SBCA obliges us to also make it available under an open source
license approved by the Free Software Foundation (FSF) or Open Source
Initiative (OSI).

If you’re contributing on behalf of your employer, make sure that anyone
signing the agreement is authorized to do so by your employer.

## Reading and signing the agreement

The full text of the agreement is [here][sbca] and can be signed electronically
